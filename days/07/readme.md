I skipped day06/p2, I might come back to it later.

## Part 1

Two operators, need to try all combos until finding the solution. This to me looked like counting in binary, `++++`, `+++*`, `++*+`, etc. And that's the direction I took.

After a few failed starts (I'm blaming Co-pilot...) I ended up with a walker function (of course), a binary counter, and a way to interpret the binary number to operators. Then it's just find value, compare to known solution, add to binary, and keeps trying.

## Part 2
